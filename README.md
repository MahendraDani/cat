# Cat - Coding Challenge
Building my own UNIX CLI utility "cat" from scratch in C.

Handle all the following cases
cat file1.txt
cat -
cat file1.txt -
cat file1.txt - file2.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt -

TODO:
The original cat commands requires all flags before the arguments, whereas the current implementation allows flags to be after the arguments.
